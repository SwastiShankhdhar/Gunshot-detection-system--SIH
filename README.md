# Gunshot-detection-system--SIH
How it works
Our pipeline, orchestrated with Python, operates with three concurrent threads: one to continuously capture audio received from an attached microphone and put two seconds worth of said audio onto an audio analysis queue; one to analyze sound samples retrieved from the audio analysis queue and verify whether or not a gunshot occurred in a given sample; and finally one to dispatch an SMS alert message to a predetermined list of phone numbers if a gunshot was detected in the segment of audio most recently analyzed.

## Hardware
Our short message service (SMS) pipeline for detecting gunshots was deployed on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ connected to an AT&T USBConnect Lightning Quickstart SMS modem as well as a Sizheng omnidirectional USB microphone.

## Models
We trained three different models on a set of nearly 60,000 two-second audio samples to distinguish gunshots from other noises. The first model was a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that takes a two-second time sequence of audio as input. The second and third models were two-dimensional convolutional neural network that takes a spectrogram of a two-second audio sample as input. For inference in practice, the decision on a sample's class was reached by majority-rules consensus between the three models.
